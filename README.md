# Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM

This project leverages deep learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. Using TensorFlow and the IMDB dataset, it trains an LSTM-based neural network to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Key Features
- **LSTM Model Architecture**: Implements a Sequential model with layers such as Embedding, LSTM, Dense, and Dropout for robust sentiment classification.
- **IMDB Dataset Utilization**: Preprocessed and padded sequences for training and testing using the IMDB dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization and sequence padding for handling text data efficiently.
- **Visualizations**: Generates graphs to visualize training accuracy, loss, and other metrics.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Structured for easy replication and experimentation.

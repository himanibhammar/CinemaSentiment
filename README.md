# Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM** project! This deep learning-based application leverages TensorFlow and the IMDB dataset to classify movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative** using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

## Key Features ðŸš€

- **LSTM Model Architecture**: A powerful neural network architecture designed for sequential data.
  - Layers: Embedding, LSTM, Dense, and Dropout for optimal performance.
- **IMDB Dataset**: Preprocessed and tokenized to train the model on a large corpus of movie reviews.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization and sequence padding to handle text data with ease.
- **Visualizations**: Dynamic graphs for training accuracy, loss, and more.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to replicate, modify, and experiment with different configurations.
